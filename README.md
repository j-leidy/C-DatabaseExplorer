# C++ Database Explorer

This program was written in c++ and utilizes the SQLITE3 Library. This program started out as a final project for a database systems class that required very little functionality. I decided to expand on the project and create a near complete Database Explorer for .db files. The goal was to gain knowledge and improve my c++ skills. 


I hope anyone that is working with SQLITE3 can learn something from the source code. If anyone has any feedback feel free to reach out.

Thank you for stopping by!
